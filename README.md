# HashPrinter

HashPrinter will turn an arbitrary length hexadecimal string into
human-readable text. It can be used to efficiently and reliably
communicate hash codes over voice communication systems.

One Application example might be the validation of a recevied
Public Key by phone call between originator and the receiver
of the public key.

Example Use:

bash-3.2$ ./sprprog.exe ABCD
badger collects dandelion.
weasel.
bash-3.2$ ./sprprog.exe 1234
woman binds birchtree.
cat.
bash-3.2$

(sprprog.exe is here the name if the HashPrinter executable)
